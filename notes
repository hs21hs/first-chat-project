potential issues:
-when we set state we use a set timeout for the next function
-when you login without a user it crashes, how can we catch this error etc?
-general error catching


-try to start programming with tdd now
-fix that when u open a chat, the previous chat shows for a split second
-implement Auth (bCrypt and JWT)

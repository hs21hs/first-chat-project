potential issues/ questions:
-learn what are the memory/speed implications. querying the db then mutating the response. of refining ur query so u get back a resp closer to what you want
-when we set state we use a set timeout for the next function
-when you login without a user it crashes, how can we catch this error etc?
-general error catching


-set up basic tests for your endpoints and make sure u commit a working version with that.
-refactor code to implement Auth (bCrypt and JWT) understand how the env variables work
-refactor tests for Auth

-fix that when u open a chat, the previous chat shows for a split second
